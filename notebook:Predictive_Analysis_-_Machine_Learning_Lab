Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
Assignment: Machine Learning Prediction
Estimated time needed: 60 minutes

Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.



Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:



Most unsuccessful landings are planed. Space X; performs a controlled landing in the oceans.

90 rows × 83 columns

TASK 1
Create a NumPy array from the column Class in data, by applying the method to_numpy() then assign it to the variable Y,make sure the output is a Pandas series (only one bracket df['name of column']).

Y = data['Class'].to_numpy()
TASK 2
Standardize the data in X then reassign it to the variable X using the transform provided below.

# students get this 
transform = preprocessing.StandardScaler()
x = transform.fit_transform(X)
We split the data into training and testing data using the function train_test_split. The training data is divided into validation data, a second set used for training data; then the models are trained and hyperparameters are selected using the function GridSearchCV.

TASK 3
Use the function train_test_split to split the data X and Y into training and test data. Set the parameter test_size to 0.2 and random_state to 2. The training data and test data should be assigned to the following labels.

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=2)
we can see we only have 18 test samples.

Y_test.shape
(18,)
TASK 4
Create a logistic regression object then create a GridSearchCV object logreg_cv with cv = 10. Fit the object to find the best parameters from the dictionary parameters.

parameters ={"C":[0.01,0.1,1],'penalty':['l2'], 'solver':['lbfgs']}# l1 lasso l2 ridge
lr=LogisticRegression()

gsvc= GridSearchCV(lr,parameters, scoring = 'accuracy',cv=10)
logreg_cv = gsvc.fit(X_train, Y_train)

We output the GridSearchCV object for logistic regression. We display the best parameters using the data attribute best_params_ and the accuracy on the validation data using the data attribute best_score_.

print("tuned hpyerparameters :(best parameters) ",logreg_cv.best_params_)
print("accuracy :",logreg_cv.best_score_)
tuned hpyerparameters :(best parameters)  {'C': 0.1, 'penalty': 'l2', 'solver': 'lbfgs'}
accuracy : 0.8196428571428571
TASK 5
Calculate the accuracy on the test data using the method score:

print('accuracy = ', logreg_cv.score(X_test, Y_test))
accuracy =  0.8333333333333334
Lets look at the confusion matrix:

yhat=logreg_cv.predict(X_test)
plot_confusion_matrix(Y_test,yhat)

Examining the confusion matrix, we see that logistic regression can distinguish between the different classes. We see that the major problem is false positives.

TASK 6
Create a support vector machine object then create a GridSearchCV object svm_cv with cv - 10. Fit the object to find the best parameters from the dictionary parameters.

svm = SVC()
gscv = GridSearchCV(svm,parameters,scoring= 'accuracy', cv =10)
