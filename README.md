SpaceX stands out as a groundbreaking company that has revolutionized the space industry by introducing rocket launches, particularly the Falcon 9, at a remarkably low cost of 62 million dollars, in stark contrast to other providers charging upwards of 165 million dollars per launch. This cost efficiency is largely attributed to SpaceX's innovative approach of reusing the first stage of the rocket, achieved by successfully landing it for subsequent missions. Iterating this process is expected to further reduce launch costs. As a data scientist at a startup competing with SpaceX, the primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning pipeline for predicting the landing outcome of the first stage in future missions. This initiative is crucial for determining the optimal pricing strategy when bidding against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
Key challenges within the project include:
Identifying all factors that impact the landing outcome.
Investigating the relationships between variables and their influence on the outcome.
Determining the optimal conditions required to enhance the probability of a successful landing.
